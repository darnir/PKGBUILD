PKGBUILD
========

This repository contains the PKGBUILDs for the various packages I maintain on
the Arch User Repository (AUR).

All these are packages that I need to use but were either not availble on the
AUR or orphaned.

Bugs Reports
------------

All PKGBUILDs submitted here have been manually checked and checked by namcap.
The corresponding package files have also been checked, hence there is little
scope for errors. However if you find any issues with the PKGBUILDs listed here,
please open on issue on GitHub or send me an email on darnir@gmail.com

List of Packages

    * libidn2: A new library which aims to replace libidn with better API but
        breaks backward compatibility.

        not based on Mozilla's PSL.
